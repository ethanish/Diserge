Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes


Thanks for reading this introduction of Diserge: Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes. ðŸ¤—

In each single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) data, each cell expresses different types of genes in different amounts. 
The cellular average expression(CAE), the average expression of all kinds of genes that each cell expresses is also going to be different.

The concept of "stability" of gene in this package refers to expression similar to cellular average expression in a scRNA-seq.

This idea followed the idea of a housekeeping gene, a widely known concept in molecular biology.

To calculate the amount of gene stability in each scRNA-seq data, we compare two single cell values.

- Pk: the amount of each gene expressed in each cell. 
- Qk: the average amount of all genes expressed in each cell.
  - Pk and Qk are list type with length n, when the scRNA-seq data has n cells after quality control.
  - Pk and Qk are divided by the sum of each list type and expressed as probabilities.

Calculated value represent how each gene is "difference" from the average level of expression in a cell.
The difference between the two probability distributions is calculated using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (
$D_{KL}$ value
), and the smaller the 
$D_{KL}$ value
, the more stable the figure is in the scRNA-seq data.
