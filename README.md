Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes


Thanks for reading this introduction of Diserge: Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes. ðŸ¤—

The concept of "stability" of gene in this package refers to expression similar to cellular average expression in a single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq).

In each scRNA-seq data, each cell has a different total expression.
