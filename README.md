Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes


Thanks for reading this introduction of Diserge: Differentially Stably Expressed single cell RNA-seq Genes. ðŸ¤—

In each single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) data, each cell has a different total expression. 
The cellular average expression(CAE), the average expression of all kinds of genes that each cell expresses is going to be different.

The concept of "stability" of gene in this package refers to expression similar to cellular average expression in a scRNA-seq.

This idea followed the idea of a housekeeping gene, a widely known concept in molecular biology.
